    """Compute impact paramaters for every charged track and combine them to obtain b-tag variables for every jet inside the event.

    The analyzer requires a resolution function for the impact parameter and a track selection function.

    In particular the analyzer does these steps:
    - loop on every charged track
        - compute the IP in the simple way
        - apply a smearing on the IP according to the resolution
        - compute track significance and track probability
    - for each jet select the tracks according to the selection function and compute
        - b tag variable, that is the probability that the jet comes from the primary vertex
        - multiplicity, invariant mass and angle wrt to jet direction for the tracks with significance larger than 3 (it's an approximation of the secondary vertex variables)

    Every variable is stored as an attribute of the corresponding object.

    Here is an example to use the code inside the configuration file.
